/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model
 * with two primary roles: "Admin" and "General User". Admins have wide-ranging
 * management permissions over system-level data like attendance sessions and user
 * profiles, while General Users are restricted to managing their own profile and
 * creating their own attendance records.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into logical top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A lookup collection where the existence of a document
 *   grants a user administrative privileges. This collection is managed out-of-band
 *   (e.g., via the Firebase Console or Admin SDK) and is read-only for clients.
 * - /attendanceSessions/{sessionId}: Contains details for attendance events, which
 *   are publicly readable by any authenticated user but managed exclusively by admins.
 * - /attendanceSessions/{sessionId}/attendanceRecords/{recordId}: A subcollection for
 *   individual user check-ins for a given session.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin status is efficiently determined by checking for the existence of a document
 *   at /roles_admin/{request.auth.uid}. This avoids storing roles on user documents,
 *   which could be manipulated by the user.
 * - General users are prohibited from listing the entire /users collection to protect
 *   user privacy. Only admins can list all users.
 * - Attendance sessions are publicly readable to all signed-in users, but all write
 *   operations (create, update, delete) are strictly limited to admins.
 * - Users can create their own attendance record, but cannot modify or delete it
 *   after the fact, ensuring the integrity of the attendance log. Only admins can
 *   manage existing records.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The `attendanceRecords` documents contain a
 * denormalized `userId` field. This allows a user to create their own record and
 * have their ownership verified (`request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`)
 * without requiring any slow or costly `get()` calls to other documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User data is segregated by path in the `/users/{userId}`
 * collection. Authorization logic is completely separated into the `/roles_admin`
 * collection, creating a clear and secure distinction between application data and
 * security metadata.
